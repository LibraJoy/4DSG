## Objective
- Capture an up-to-date intro/status snapshot for the Dockerized DovSG/3DSG stack.
- Deliver the standard onboarding summary (mission, first steps, alignment questions) in chat.

## Constraints & References
- Follow `.CLAUDE.md` guardrails (minimal diffs, record worklog, no long-running commands).
- Deliverable A lives at `.claude/reports/project_intro_status.md` with the specified outline.
- Call out missing canonical docs (e.g., `docker/README.md`) if encountered.
- Log concrete edits to `.claude/worklog.md`.

## Plan
1. **Context Review**  
   - Skim `docker/README.md`, `docker/MANUAL_VERIFICATION.md`, and existing reports/tasks to confirm current project objective, health notes, and any decision records.  
   - Check for referenced-but-missing docs; note any gaps for later callouts.
2. **Draft Project Intro/Status Report**  
   - Outline the required sections matching Deliverable A structure.  
   - Summarize current progress/risks using findings from the context review and repository notes.  
   - Ensure executive summary is concise (4–6 sentences) and avoids redundant command listings.  
   - Verify references (links/paths) exist or explicitly mark missing ones.
3. **Update Repository Artifacts**  
   - Write the finished report to `.claude/reports/project_intro_status.md`.  
   - Append a short activity log entry to `.claude/worklog.md` describing created/updated files.
4. **Prepare Onboarding Response**  
   - Craft mission summary bullets, first-step checklist (≤8 items, commands only – not executed), and alignment questions per Deliverable B.  
   - Ensure chat response notes any missing docs discovered earlier.

## Open Questions / Assumptions
- Assume existing docs reflect the latest pipeline state unless contradictions arise.  
- Pending confirmation that no additional approvals are required for lightweight file edits; will proceed accordingly once plan is approved.
